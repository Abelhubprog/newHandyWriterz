# Project Recap: Admin Dashboard Rebuild

This document outlines the work completed to rebuild the admin dashboard, the architectural decisions made, the files created, and the pending tasks required to make the application fully production-ready.

## 1. Project Goal

The primary objective was to replace the legacy admin dashboard, which was spread across `src/admin` and `src/app/admin`, with a modern, robust, and scalable solution. The new dashboard is built from the ground up using a feature-sliced architecture and production-grade components.

## 2. What Was Done

### 2.1. Architectural Refactoring

The first major step was to establish a clean and scalable architecture.

-   **Feature-Sliced Architecture:** All legacy admin code was consolidated and migrated into a new `src/features/` directory. Each major section of the dashboard (Posts, Users, Files, etc.) is now a self-contained "feature" with its own components, data schemas, and pages.
    -   **Key Directory:** `src/features/`

-   **Centralized Routing:** A dedicated admin router was created to manage all routes within the dashboard. This router is protected by the existing `AdminGuard` to ensure only authenticated administrators can access it.
    -   **Key Files:**
        -   `src/features/router.tsx`: Defines all routes for the admin dashboard (e.g., `/admin/posts`, `/admin/users`).
        -   `src/router.tsx`: The main application router was updated to import and integrate the admin routes.

### 2.2. Core UI Implementation

A consistent and reusable UI foundation was built for the entire admin experience.

-   **Admin Layout:** A new, responsive admin layout was created from scratch.
    -   **Key Files:**
        -   `src/features/common/layouts/AdminLayout.tsx`: The main layout shell that orchestrates the sidebar and header.
        -   `src/features/common/components/navigation/Sidebar.tsx`: The primary navigation menu for the dashboard.
        -   `src/features/common/components/navigation/Header.tsx`: The top header containing search functionality and the Clerk `UserButton`.

-   **Reusable Data Table:** A generic and powerful `DataTable` component was built using `@tanstack/react-table`. This component provides sorting, filtering, pagination, and row actions out of the box and is used by all feature modules.
    -   **Key Directory:** `src/features/common/components/datatable/`

### 2.3. Feature Module Implementation

The following feature modules were built, each providing a complete management interface with mock data.

-   **Dashboard:** The main landing page providing an overview of site statistics and recent activity.
    -   **Key Files:** `src/features/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx` and its components in `src/features/dashboard/components/`.

-   **Posts, Users, Files, Messages, Comments:** Five distinct management pages were created. Each follows a consistent pattern:
    1.  **Data Schema (`schema.ts`):** A Zod schema defines the data structure for the feature (e.g., `postSchema`).
    2.  **Mock Data (`seed.ts`):** A seed file using `@faker-js/faker` generates 100 realistic data objects.
    3.  **Table Columns (`columns.tsx`):** Defines the structure, appearance, and behavior of the data table columns.
    4.  **Row Actions (`DataTableRowActions.tsx`):** A component defining the dropdown menu actions for each row (e.g., Edit, Delete).
    5.  **Page Component (`Posts.tsx`, `Users.tsx`, etc.):** Assembles the `DataTable` with the corresponding columns and data.
    -   **Key Directories:**
        -   `src/features/posts/`
        -   `src/features/users/`
        -   `src/features/files/`
        -   `src/features/messages/`
        -   `src/features/comments/`

-   **Settings:** A form-based page for managing user and application settings.
    -   **Key Files:**
        -   `src/features/settings/Settings.tsx`
        -   `src/features/settings/components/ProfileForm.tsx`

### 2.4. Final Cleanup

To complete the migration, all legacy and now-unused directories were removed, leaving a clean and modern project structure.
-   **Removed Directories:** `src/admin`, `src/app`, `src/components/admin`.

## 3. Pending Work & Next Steps

The current implementation provides a complete UI and architectural foundation. The following tasks are pending to make the dashboard fully functional and ready for production:

-   **Data Integration:**
    -   **Task:** Replace all mock data (`seed.ts` files) with live data from the backend API.
    -   **Action:** Implement data-fetching logic, likely using hooks (e.g., with `react-query` or `swr`) within each feature's page component (`Posts.tsx`, `Users.tsx`, etc.).

-   **Implement Row Actions:**
    -   **Task:** Wire up the UI actions in each `DataTableRowActions.tsx` component to perform real operations.
    -   **Action:** Create API service functions for `delete`, `update`, `approve`, etc., and call them from the action components. Provide feedback to the user (e.g., toasts, loading states).

-   **Implement Form Logic:**
    -   **Task:** Make the "Update profile" button in the Settings page functional.
    -   **Action:** Implement the `onSubmit` function in `src/features/settings/components/ProfileForm.tsx` to call an API endpoint that updates user data.

-   **UI/UX Refinements:**
    -   **Task:** Enhance the user experience.
    -   **Action:**
        -   Add loading states (e.g., skeletons) while data is being fetched.
        -   Implement empty states for tables when no data is available.
        -   Build out the navigation in the Settings page to support multiple sections (e.g., Appearance, Notifications).

-   **Testing:**
    -   **Task:** Ensure the reliability and stability of the new dashboard.
    -   **Action:** Write unit and integration tests for the new components, especially the data tables and forms.
